Multiple Linear Regression: Boston Housing Analysis

This Jupyter Notebook analyzes the Boston housing dataset to predict house prices using a multiple linear regression model. The process involves loading the data, splitting it into training and testing sets, and standardizing the features. The model's performance is then evaluated using cross-validation and the R
