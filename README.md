* Multiple Linear Regression: Boston Housing Analysis

This Jupyter Notebook analyzes the Boston housing dataset to predict house prices using a multiple linear regression model. The process involves loading the data, splitting it into training and testing sets, and standardizing the features. The model's performance is then evaluated using cross-validation and the R 
2
  score.


* Linear Regression: USA Housing Price Prediction

This Jupyter Notebook, titled "Linear Regression USA Housing Price Prediction," analyzes a housing dataset to predict house prices using a multiple linear regression model. The pipeline involves loading the data, performing exploratory data analysis, and preparing the data for the model. The data is then split into training and testing sets, a linear regression model is trained, and its performance is evaluated.
